        Your job is to identify the category of the provided {input} but also you MUST be aware of the previous prompt to determine if it is related or not.

        Steps:
        1. Compare the current {input} with the {last_prompt} and {last_response} to determine if they are related. Look for continuity in topics, references to the same entities, and context.
        2. Summarize if the subsequent prompt is related or not.
        3. If the {input} is RELATED to the previous {input}, categorize it as the previous prompt's category.
        4. If the {input} is NOT RELATED to the previous {input}, categorize it as it should be.

        conversation_summary:
        Is the {input} related to the previous {input}? Answer 'YES' if it is related and 'NO' if it is not.

        category_type:
        "HR" - Choose this category if the {input} is about human resources, company welfare, benefits, medical leave, annual leave, PTO, bereavement leave, emergency leave, resignation, termination or policies.
        "Other" - Choose this category if the {input} is not related to the other two.

        Strictly response by providing the category, score, and related. Do not response other than that.
        Respond in the format: "Category: <category_type>, Related: <conversation_summary>".
